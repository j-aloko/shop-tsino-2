Whether you're a developer looking to customize the storefront or a store owner wanting to understand how it works, this documentation is here to guide you.

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of our custom Shopify storefront, which leverages the power of Next.js and Shopify's GraphQL APIs to deliver a unique and optimized shopping experience.

## Technologies Used

Our storefront is built using **Next.js**, a popular React framework that enables features like server-side rendering and static site generation. We also use [Shopify's Storefront](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront) and [Admin GraphQL APIs](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql) to fetch and manage data directly from Shopify. Other technologies used include Redux Toolkit for state management, Material-UI for UI components, and next-i18next for translating static resources.

## Architecture

Our ecommerce storefront architecture is meticulously crafted to harness the full potential of **Next.js**, **Shopify's APIs**, and **Redux Toolkit**.

At the heart of our architecture is **Next.js**, a powerful React framework that takes charge of the frontend. It is responsible for rendering our React components and serving our pages, ensuring a seamless and responsive user interface.

The **Shopify's Storefront and Admin GraphQL APIs** play a crucial role in our architecture. They are used to fetch product data, manage shopping carts, handle customer accounts, and process orders. This integration with Shopify's APIs allows us to provide a robust and reliable ecommerce solution.

To manage the application state, we employ the **Redux Toolkit**, a modern, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies the Redux setup and includes utilities to simplify tasks like performing asynchronous logic with **async thunks**.

Async thunks are used to handle asynchronous operations, allowing us to write Redux logic that interacts with the server. This ensures that our application remains responsive and performant, even when dealing with complex state management.

In summary, our architecture is a harmonious blend of Next.js for frontend rendering, Shopify's APIs for data management, and Redux Toolkit with async thunks for state management, providing a comprehensive, efficient, and scalable solution for custom ecommerce storefronts. This architecture not only delivers stunning visuals but also ensures a smooth and engaging shopping experience for our customers.

## Codebase Structure

Our codebase is meticulously structured to promote both reusability and maintainability:

- **Pages Directory**: This directory is specific to Next.js and is where all the page components reside. Each file corresponds to a route based on its name. This is where we leverage the power of Next.js's file-system based routing.

- **API Directory**: This directory contains all the API calls to Shopify's Storefront and Admin GraphQL APIs. It helps to keep our API calls isolated and organized.

- **Components Directory**: This is where all reusable UI components are stored. Each component is designed to be stateless and only takes props, ensuring maximum reusability across different parts of the application.

- **Containers Directory**: This directory houses the execution of state management logic, hooks, custom hooks, and API interactions. Containers are where data is fetched and state is accessed, which are then passed as props to components. This separation of concerns allows our components to remain clean and focused on presentation.

- **Hooks Directory**: All custom hooks are stored in this directory. These hooks encapsulate complex logic, such as state management and side effects, into reusable functions. This helps to keep our components clean and focused on rendering.

- **Services Directory**: This is where we manage our Redux state and asynchronous middleware with Redux Toolkit. It also contains the implementations for interacting with Shopify's Storefront and Admin GraphQL APIs. By isolating these services, we ensure that any changes to our data fetching logic or state management don't affect the rest of the codebase.

- **Public/Locales Directory**: This directory stores translations of static resources in English, Spanish (Espanol), and French. These translations allow us to easily internationalize our storefront. Additional languages can be added as needed.

- **Utils Directory**: This directory contains utility functions that are used across the application. It promotes code reusability and cleanliness.

- **Styles Directory**: This directory contains all the global styles and theme related files. It helps to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.

- **Theme Directory**: This directory is dedicated to customizing the application's theme. It includes all the necessary configurations for typography, color schemes, and other stylistic elements. This centralized approach to styling makes it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel across the entire application.

## Styling and Responsive Design

Styling is handled using a combination of Material-UI, react-bootstrap for carousel, and traditional CSS. We've also implemented a responsive design, ensuring our storefront looks great on devices of all sizes.

## Performance Optimization

In the development of our custom Shopify storefront, we've strategically leveraged several performance optimization techniques provided by Next.js:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: We utilize SSR to render pages on the server before sending them to the client, resulting in faster page loads and improved SEO.

- **Automatic Code Splitting**: We take advantage of Next.js's automatic code splitting feature, which splits the code into smaller chunks that are only loaded when needed, reducing the initial load time.

- **Image Optimization**: We use the built-in Image component in Next.js to optimize images for different device sizes and support lazy loading, improving performance by loading images only when they enter the viewport.

- **Dynamic Imports**: We use dynamic imports to load modules only when they are required, reducing the size of the initial JavaScript bundle.

- **Caching**: We leverage both client-side and server-side caching to reduce network requests and improve performance.

- **Client-Side Rendering**: We use partial hydration, or client-side rendering, to boost performance by only rendering parts of the page that are needed.
